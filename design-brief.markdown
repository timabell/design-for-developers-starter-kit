# Xchain mvp site Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
*What problems are you trying to solve? What is the purpose of the app? (2-3 sentences)*

People in the propery market should be able to advertise their intention to sell as well as to buy, and to make contact with each other through membership of Xchain.co.uk

## The key users.
*Describe behaviors, expectation, knowledge, or other characteristics. (One sentence each)*

* Buyers - someone looking to buy a house who's been frustrated in their efforts and would be open to listing their intention publically in a searchable online database
* Sellers - discover that there's a buyer who already intends to buy a house with a matching location / spec. Optionally lists their house if they don't find a match.

These might be the same person sometimes, i.e. someone in the middle of the chain, but they'll usually come with one intention first, and fill in the other later (hunch).

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*

* Buyers - register on the site, advertise their intention to buy in a particular location and wait for a bite, secondly search for existing listings like on rightmove; may pay membership to contact a seller they've found on Xchain
* Sellers - find a buyer and pay membership to make contact with them

## Design style guidelines to follow.
*These are a list of qualities or characteristics (usually adjectives) you'd like the design to follow. The more specific you are with these the easier it will be for you to create a compelling design (e.g. don't use "Clean"). (2-3 words)*

The design needs to inspire sufficient confidence in Xchain that users will invest the time in registering their details.
